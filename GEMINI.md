# Baserow to Supabase Sync Workflow

This document outlines the process for syncing new assignments and grades from your Baserow database to the Supabase gradebook.

This is an interactive, guided process. I will act as the script to ensure you are always working with the latest data from Baserow.

### How to Sync Your Assignments

1.  **Start the Process:** When you have new assignments in Baserow that you want to import into the gradebook, simply tell me: **"I'm ready to sync my assignments."**

2.  **I'll Fetch Your Data:** I will then connect to your Baserow account and fetch the most up-to-date list of all scorable assignment columns.

3.  **Select Your Assignments:** I will present you with a checklist of the available assignments. You will select the ones you wish to import.

4.  **Provide Details:** For each assignment you select, I will ask you to provide the **due date** and the **assignment type** (Daily or Assessment).

5.  **Sync Complete:** Once I have all the necessary information, I will automatically create the new assignments in Supabase and populate them with the corresponding grades from your Baserow data.
